## The project

This is a MERN stack project where you can collect your dreams (with additional emotion tags). You can search by text, filter by time and by tags. It was designed to show the optimal layout for each page depending on the screen size.

Features:
- Add dream
- Edit dream
- Delete dream
- Search by text
- Filter by time
- Filter by emotions
